## Notes

- The symbols on the buttons are printed by changing the filament color on the last layer.
- The button sleeves make sure the buttons stay in place. They are printed separately to allow for redesigning them depending on the distance between the circuit board and controller case.
- The connecter is designed to be fitted with standard male / female circuit board headers.
